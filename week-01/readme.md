### WISH
I had some experiences of making web, but never learned how to implement it systematically. Because of that, I'm easily get stuck while doing my project every time. Therefore, I want to learn the foundations of web, frontend, backend, etc. I hope that I can get a better understanding of the whole structure of the web and solidify my foundamentals via this class.

Oh, by the way, I use English to write this because I want to train my English expression, please bear with me.
