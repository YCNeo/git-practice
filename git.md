### Q2

### Q3
I always use syntax like this:
`feat(scope): commit message`
eg. `feat(login): wireframe`

* I think the syntax of commit message is important because commit message is the most direct part of a commit to let developers know what happened in the commit, and if one day I want to revert or restore the commit, I will be much easy to find which version is waht I want.
